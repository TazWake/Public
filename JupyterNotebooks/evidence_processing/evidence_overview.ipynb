        "# 🧠 Linux Evidence Overview & Triage Notebook\n",
        "\n",
        "This notebook is designed to help an investigator perform a quick, visual triage of a **mounted Linux evidence image** over a specified time window.\n",
        "\n",
        "It focuses on four questions:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Who logged in, from where, and when?** (user login events)\n",
        "2. **What commands were run?** (stack‑ranked from the audit log, if present)\n",
        "3. **What executable files appeared?** (new or modified executables in the window)\n",
        "4. **What SUID/SGID/sticky files exist?** (potential privilege‑escalation footholds)\n",
        "\n",
        "## Environment prerequisites\n",
        "\n",
        "The notebook expects a Python environment with at least:\n",
        "\n",
        "- `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`\n",
        "- A compatible `scipy` / `numpy` combination. If you see an error like *\"A NumPy version >=1.17.3 and <1.25.0 is required for this version of SciPy\"*, run:\n",
        "  ```bash\n",
        "  pip install --upgrade scipy\n",
        "  ```\n",
        "  in the same environment as the notebook, then restart the kernel.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Workflow\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Mount your evidence image read‑only** so that it looks like a normal Linux filesystem (for example at `/mnt/evidence`).\n",
        "2. In the next cell, set:\n",
        "   - `EVIDENCE_ROOT` to the mount point of the evidence image, and\n",
        "   - `DATE_FROM` / `DATE_TO` to the investigation time window.\n",
        "3. Run each section in order. Each will:\n",
        "   - Check for the relevant log / filesystem artifacts under `EVIDENCE_ROOT`.\n",
        "   - Limit analysis to the date range you specify.\n",
        "   - Produce **tables and charts** to help highlight anomalies.\n",
        "\n",
        "> **Note:** This notebook is **read‑only** with respect to the evidence. It walks the filesystem and parses log files, but does not modify them. Always work from a copy of the acquired evidence, not from original media.\n"
